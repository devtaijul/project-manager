# Task Management App

This is a task management application built with Vite and React, featuring a task list with essential functionalities like task creation, editing, deletion, search, and sorting. It demonstrates effective use of Reactâ€™s Context API and useReducer to manage application state without any page reloads.

## Features

1. **Task Creation with Popup**:

   - Clicking on the "Add" button opens a popup for task creation.
   - Tasks can be assigned a Title, Description, Date, and Category.
   - New tasks appear under the selected Category column.

2. **Validation**:

   - Fields like Title, Description, Date, and Category are required.
   - Warning messages appear if fields are left empty.
   - Optional: React Toastify is used for warnings.

3. **Task Editing**:

   - Each task has a Pencil icon, which allows for editing within the popup form.

4. **Task Deletion**:

   - Tasks can be deleted by clicking on the Delete button.

5. **Search Functionality**:

   - Search tasks by title. Search results filter across all columns.
   - If the search bar is empty, all tasks are displayed.

7. **Task Count Display**:

   - Each column header shows the number of tasks in that category.
